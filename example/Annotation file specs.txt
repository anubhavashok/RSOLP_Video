Annotation file format (notes are enclosed in () and [])
See the annotations.txt file for examples; the format is roughly like this:

box (8 vertices of the box in image space)
8
[x1 y1]
...
[x8 y8]

box3d (corresponding 3D locations of the box; obtained by back-projection i.e. box3d = (K*R)^{-1}*box)
8
[X1 Y1 Z1]
...

[X8 Y8 Z8]

K
[3x3 proj matrix as 9 row-wise values; e.g. focal 0 centerx 0 focal centery 0 0 1]

R
[3x3 rotation (extrinsic without translation since translation assumed to be 0)]

light (area light source defined by a 2d polygon in the image)
N (number of points in the light polygon)
[x1 y1]
...
[xN yN]

surface (extruded surface from the ground)
M+2
[x1 y1]
...
[xM yM]
[x_top y_top] (point on the top of the object)
[x_base y_base] (point beneath x_top y_top on the ground plane)
[solid or surface] (0 = surface i.e. only extrude a plane from the ground; 1 = solid extrusion)

You can have as many "light" and "surface" annotations as necessary.
These annotations will make more sense also if you're familiar with the RSOLP creator tutorial videos (found in the help tab of the online creation tool: http://www.kevinkarsch.com/rsolp/create/).


Coordinate systems:

Image space (2D)

y

Box corner indices corresponding to [x1 y1], ..., [x8 y8] above (not all corners must lie in the image; corners 5-8 and possibly others will usually be outside the image).
